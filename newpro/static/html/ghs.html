Semmozhi Poonga is one of the most visited botanical gardens in all of Chennai. The beautiful landscaping at the garden has not only made it a delight for the daily morning walkers but has also attracted film makers and tourists. A huge parking lot, a canteen that serves delicious refreshments, and a beautiful artificial pond with ducks that are the childrenâ€™s favorite, Semmozhi Poonga has become a must visit destination in the city.
